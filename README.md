# Where is my server?

A REST API service in GO to connect up Users and their designated Server.

A simple project to allow me to learn GO. While there are some nice frameworks and libraries out there, my aim is to use the GO built-in libraries wherever possible.

## Tools used for this project

- Using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) with [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime) package for editing GO files.
- Also using a cool utility called [Gin](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin) to reloaded my Web Server code as soon as I modified it. Run using `gin -a "8080" run`.
